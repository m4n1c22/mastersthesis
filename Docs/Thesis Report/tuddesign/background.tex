\section{Software Verification}

Software programs are becoming increasingly complex. 
With the rise in complexity and technological advancements, components within a software have become susceptible to various erroneous conditions. 
Software verification have been perceived as a solution for the problems arising in the software development cycle. 
Software verification is primarily verifying if the specifications are met by the software. 
There are two fundamental approaches used in software verification - dynamic and static verifications. 
Dynamic verification is performed in conjunction with the execution of the software. 
It dynamically checks the behavior of the execution program - commonly known as Test phase. 
Verification is succeeding phase also known as Review phase. 
In dynamic verification, the verification adheres the concept of test and experimentation. 
The verification process handles the test of the behavior of the program under different execution conditions. 
Static verification is the complete opposite of the previous methodology. 
The verification process is handled by checking the code of the execution program before its execution.
